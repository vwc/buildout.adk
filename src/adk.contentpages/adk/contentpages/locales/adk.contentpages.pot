This initial payment serves as a deposit and is part of your tuition fee. In the case of a last minute booking (up to 2 days before the course start date), an individual arrangement will be agreed upon with ADK. The information about the host family and further details will be sent to you by then as well. Your registration for a German language course is only completed when you have made the required payments and have received a registration confirmation from us. Participants requiring a visa should register at least 2 months prior to the beginning of the course. With your application you accept the terms and conditions of ADK. The application is legally valid and you are bound by this contract to pay the course fees. Course fees are exclusive of VAT. With your registration you accept the terms and conditions."
